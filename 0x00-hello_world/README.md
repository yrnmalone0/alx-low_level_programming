# 0x00. C - Hello, World
This is a C Programming project under ALX Software Engineering program. The C program uses the GCC compiler in its compilation process.

### Files:

- **0-Preprocessor** - A Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file `c`.

- **1-compiler** - A bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` but does not link. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.

- **2-assembler** - A bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE` in an output file. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
