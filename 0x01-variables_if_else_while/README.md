# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
This project simply covers `Variables`, `if`, `else`, `while` conditions in C Programming. I have been able to learn how to declare variables of types and assign values to it as well, how to implement `if`, `if` ... `else` statements and the likes.

### Files:

**0-positive_or_negative.c** - Assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

**1-last_digit.c** - Assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`. It prints out the string `Last digit of`, followed by `n`, followed by the string `is`, followed by if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and` `is greater than 5`, if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string and is 0 and if the last digit of `n` `is` less than 6 and not 0: the string `and` `is` `less than 6 and not 0`

**2-print_alphabet.c** - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. A `putchar` function was implemented in the program.

**3-print_alphabets.c** - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

**4-print_alphabt.c** - Prints the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e`, followed by a new line.

**5-print_numbers.c** - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

**6-print_numberz.c** - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line and contains `putchar` function.

**7-print_tebahpla.c** - Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

**8-print_base16.c** Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**9-print_comb.c** - Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
